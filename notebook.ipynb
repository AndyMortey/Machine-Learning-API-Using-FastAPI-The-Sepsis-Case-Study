    "#### Sepsis is a critical health condition with significant implications for patient outcomes and healthcare systems. Predicting and managing sepsis effectively can reduce mortality rates, improve patient recovery, and decrease healthcare costs. This project aims to leverage machine learning models and FastAPI to predict sepsis, thereby enabling timely interventions and enhancing clinical decision-making. This project aims to enhance the early detection and management of sepsis through a machine learning-based predictive model deployed as an API with FastAPI. By addressing a critical healthcare challenge, the project seeks to improve patient outcomes, optimize resource utilization, and provide valuable decision support for healthcare providers. The success of the project will be measured by its impact on clinical practice and its ability to deliver timely, accurate predictions in a real-world healthcare setting."
